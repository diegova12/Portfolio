# Stock Market Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the stock market using machine learning techniques. The main focus is on developing a model that can predict the direction of the S&P 500 index.

## Project Overview

This project includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Backtesting

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction.git
    cd stock-market-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Stock-Market-Model.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to see the data processing, model training, and prediction steps.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Historical data for the S&P 500 index is collected and loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Feature Engineering**: New features are created from the existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
3. **Model Training**: A RandomForestClassifier is used to train the model.
4. **Prediction**: The model predicts the probability of the index moving up or down.
5. **Backtesting**: The model's predictions are evaluated against historical data to assess its performance.

## Results

- The model achieved a precision score of 0.57, indicating its accuracy in predicting the stock market direction.
